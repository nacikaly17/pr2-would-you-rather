# pr2-would-you-rather
A web app build with  React and Redux that lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game.
#### Udacity React Nanodegree program
This project is connected to the _React Nanodegree Program_ course by **Udacity**.

In this Project called “Would You Rather”, build a web app that lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.
In the app, users will be able to answer questions, see which questions they haven’t answered, see how other people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.
This web app should  build with  React and Redux.It should demonstrate the implementation of  application’s state; establish strict rules for getting, listening, and updating the store; and identify what state should live inside of Redux and what state should live inside of React components.
